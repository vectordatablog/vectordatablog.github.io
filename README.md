### Azure Tenant

An Azure tenant is a dedicated and isolated instance of the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) service, used to manage identities and access to resources in Microsoft Azure. It provides a unique identity and access management system for each organization that uses Azure. A tenant is created when an organization signs up for a Microsoft cloud service like Azure or Office 365.
